# Oxide Linux
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/oxide-spec/badge/?version=latest)](https://oxide.gracen.dev/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Oxide Linux is an uncreatively named Linux distro built from the ground up in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org)!
Like all other passion projects of mine &mdash; both public and private &mdash; Oxide Linux is a massive
work in progress. It's undergoing active development, but I don't guarantee that it will be in a releasable
state any time soon.
