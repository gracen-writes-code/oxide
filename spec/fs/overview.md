# Oxide Filesystem Standard

Oxide's filesystem design adheres to a version of the [Filesystem Hierarchy Standard](https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/fhs.shtml)
modified to better suit Oxide's [design principles](design.md). Oxide tries its best
to not deviate too much from the FHS &mdash; standards exist for a reason &mdash; but
it doesn't treat it as set in stone.

**NOTICE**: The filesystem spec is currently in early development. 
Expect incompleteness and frequent changes.
