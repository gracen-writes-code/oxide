# Oxide Filesystem Standard

Oxide's filesystem, similar to many other components of Oxide, does not adhere to common standards (see [Compatibility](/en/latest/compat/)). Rather, it tries to create a filesystem that best fits its own design philosophy. Oxide's filesystem tries to make it easy to develop software within Oxide's ecosystem while also making it simple to be a casual user without ever having to peek behind the proverbial curtain.

**NOTICE**: The filesystem spec is currently in early development. Expect incompleteness and frequent changes.
