# Setting Up Oxide

Now that you've installed Oxide, it's time to get the system set up! Oxide starts out very minimal and pretty much all of its functionality is user-defined, but the eventual goal is to give the user the choice to either use a simple installer or to configure the entire system themself.

Once you boot up your system with Oxide, you'll find yourself dropped into a recovery shell with an error telling you that the system unit could not be found. You'll have to set this up yourself! Unfortunately, I haven't implemented the functionality to actually create a unit fully within Oxide, so your system will be stuck in this recovery shell forever!
