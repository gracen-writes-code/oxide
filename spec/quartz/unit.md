# Units

Units are the basic components of a `quartz` system. Units are uniquely defined by the directories they reside in, which can be placed anywhere as long as they can be found by their parent unit.

## System Unit
The system unit is the entry point for all other units, and it is defined in the `/system` directory. It is run directly by `quartz` with root privileges.
